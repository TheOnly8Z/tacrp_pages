Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that a second ~~plane~~ update has hit the ~~tower~~ Steam Workshop.

Aside from some requested features and QoL improvements, we also added scope glints and a blinding mechanic to the Flashlight, both which are sure to brighten your day. And eyes. Better wear sunglasses.

## Highlights

### üéµ Oh Camper, Camper
Snipers. Love'em, hate'em, they're tactical as hell; but they can be too well hidden to be fun to fight against.

To counter this, we've polished the scope lens so that they give away an unmistakable glint. The higher the scope's magnification, the more noticeable it is. Glint is visible even when not aiming, but becomes larger and more visible when aiming.

Additionally, limb damage multipliers for snipers have been reduced. Aim your damn shots!

### üî¶ Stare Into The Sun
Poor flashlight. Always the runt of the litter, offering nothing compared to the other attachments in its slot. Well, the tactical gods are kind and generous, and they have bestowed upon it an ancient technique from the year 2011...

Flashlights now produce a glare sprite, similar to the ones in Battlefield 3. Up close and front, it is large enough to conceal the user's silhouette, but the range is very short.

However, its light is devestating against any kind of scoped optic. If pointed directly at the target, the shooter will find their view blinded by the flashlight! The effect size is dependent on the viewing angle and distance between the flashlight and the scope.

The new Flashlight should serve as a good counter to snipers and other scoped rifles at close to medium distances, and give the user an edge at point blank. To counter it, players need to peek or use a reflex/holographic sight, giving up some ranged advantage, or move past its effective range (about 4096HU in scope and 328HU without).

The blinding effect can be turned off in the options. If turned off, a small glare that doesn't obstruct the view as much is used instead.

### üßê Such Tactical, Many Realism
The other tactical attachments also got a few touches.

The Radar's beeping is made quieter when nothing is around. You can disable it for yourself if you still find it too grating - but this doesn't affect other players hearing your radar (and you hearing theirs)!

Also, you can now tell if the target is above or below you, as they will show up as a pointed triangle.

The Rangefinder and Spread Gauge now use the point of aim after sway. Rangefinder also has a cross indicating range added (fades out at minimum damage), which is usable even with Physical Bullets off.

We've also fixed lasers having the wrong render order and drawing underneath players.

### üîç Toggle Aiming
Give your index finger a rest - you can now toggle aiming instead of having to hold it down.

### üëä Out of Ammo, But Not Out Of Options
Getting caught with your pants down is not very tactical. Now, you can break out of a reload instantly by melee bashing or quickthrowing.

Shotguns are also more responsive to reload cancelling now. You can interrupt the reload at any point, and if you interrupted it before a round was loaded, the finish animation doesn't play and you can start firing faster.
