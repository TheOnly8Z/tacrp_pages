An update has been pushed to the TacRP workshop. As we haven't been tracking version numbers prior, this is the first numbered update.

The big thing here is our fresh newsletter system for tracking updates and news; besides that, there's just a few bug fixes. The good stuff is still being worked on!

If you encounter any issues, you can always report them in the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/HaodongMo/tacrp/issues) or the [Diamond Doves Discord](https://discord.gg/gaHXusZ).

## Update Notes

- **Added:** Newsletter system. Loads local and remote pages and renders them inside the game with HTML.
- **Added:** A few serverside ConVars for disabling HUD, drawing of holstered weapons, and the newsletter.
- **Fixed:** Flashbang traces not hitting others.
- **Fixed:** Burst fire "ghost bullets".
- **Fixed:** Blindfire delay not taking effect.
- **Fixed:** Suiciding on death not resetting bones.
- **Fixed:** Lambda Players taking double damage on headshot.
- **Fixed:** Small mag bodygroup being used with Hollowpoints even though they don't decrease capacity anymore.
