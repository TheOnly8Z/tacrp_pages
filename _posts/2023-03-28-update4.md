Here at **Tactical Realism Industries‚Ñ¢** we strive for nothing but the most tactical and most realistic features. That's why today we are proud to introduce content that will allow you to replicate the experience of fending for your life in the most tactical locale of all...

*England.*

## üî™ Oi, You Got A Loicence For Stabbin' Or Whut?

The knife has been sitting in the files for a while (since TacRP's release, actually), so it's about time they finally get implemented. There is also a hidden WIP knife in Tactical Intervention's files that has been added. I've edited the animations so you do a stylish catch on deploy instead of the flip knife's flip.

I figured that simply having a melee weapon is too boring, so I added a few attachments while I'm at it.

Well, some are more tactical than others.

By itself, the knife has only a primary attack, but it has two attachment slots that unlock secondary attacks and special moves. Hopefully you have as much fun using them as I had fun making them!

### Alt-fire

**Heavy-handed** is the bog-standard heavy attack, but it adds backstab damage allowing for an instant kill.

**High Guard** allows you to block melee attacks and thrown projectiles. On a successful block, you can immediately follow up with a counter-attack, which is a heavy attack that will disarm your opponent.

**Knife Throw** gives you a projectile attack. It deals the same damage as the light attack, but can double its damage if you hit a headshot or airborne opponent for up to 4 times damage.

**Grenadier** makes your secondary attack a quickthrow and unlocks rocks, like the regular perk. Knives innately have a faster quickthrow but this will boost it even further.

### Reload

**Airdash** gives you up to 3 Ultrakill-esque dashes for mobility. You are briefly invulnerable during the dash, and it can cancel your momentum for 180 turns and fall damage cancelling.

**Ninja** unlocks a suite of disruption and mobility options.

- Perform a *palm strike* to stun enemies and knock them into the air - players who try to block this will be disarmed.
- Hit a wall with a palm strike while standing still to reach heights.
- While in the air, you can *dive kick* to reach the ground quickly. This cancels fall damage, and a hard landing will launch everything nearby upwards.
- On the ground, a *smokescreen* is available. When used, it instantly drops a puff of smoke and gas hybrid (you are not affected by the gas). You can also leap backwards while doing so by looking opposite of your movement direction.
- Finally, you also get silent footsteps while using this perk.

**Frenzy** allows you to leap great distances or redirect your movement while in the air. You also gain some health back when you do damage, allowing you to stay aggressive.

**Bombardier** modifies your quickthrow grenades to detonate on impact instead of being time-based. However, they're slower to throw and the lethal grenades do less damage.

## üí£ Where's Our Fire Support?!
Added Mortar RPG rounds. Made for medium range indirect fire, these rockets have a generous blast radius but requires some air time to reach their full potential.

## üóÑÔ∏è You Ain't No Walking Arsenal

Slot limiting feaures have been expanded. The limit can now be any number, not just one. Plus, you can now choose what happens if you spawn a TacRP weapon when the slot is occupied - either fail (do nothing), remove the old weapon, or drop the old weapon.

By popular request, you can also now set weapons to use HL2 styled slots, where MGs, Sniper Rifles and Shotguns use slot 4 and explosive stuff uses slot 5.
