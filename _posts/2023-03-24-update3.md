Wouldn't be a real TacRP update if I didn't push something broken. Render issues with the glint and glare are fixed.

One new feature though: Various obscuring and blinding effects now block TargetID, so you can't magically know where the enemy is when disrupted. As far as I know, this would make TacRP the first GMod addon to ever bother implementing something like this. 

The glint on flashlights shine through smoke, but let's just call that intended behavior.

Now go out there and hotbox some enemies.

## Update Notes

- **Added:** Flashlight glint, flashbang and smoke will block TargetID.
- **Changed:** Recoil shake is now based on fraction of recoil amount, and is reduced overall.
- **Fixed:** Flashlight glint and scope glare drawing behind transparent player parts (like glasses).
- **Fixed:** Flashlight glint and scope glare not drawing at all sometimes.
- **Fixed:** Holstered weapons drawing in front of transparent things.
- **Fixed:** PGM Hecate II having a broken wrist. That looked painful.
- **Fixed:** I definitely broke recoil, I'm just not sure how.
- **Rebalance:** Smoke effect size increased from 256 to 300.
