It's my birthday today! ðŸ¥³

I just released an addon I've been working on a for a while - **Danger Zone Entities**. Feel free to check it out! It fully supports TacRP, but I will add more TacRP integration with it in the future.

In more relevant news, the expansion pack I promised is around the horizon! I couldn't get it fully polished, but it will be coming within a week or so alongside a major TacRP update.
